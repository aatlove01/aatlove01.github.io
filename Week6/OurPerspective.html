            all of the suggestions shown are searches taken from the artist'â€™ own internet history 
            - They are mostly random and/or ambiguous searches
            - By clicking at one of them, the websites sends you to the actual landing page of the search
            - The user is thus using a search engine limited by what the artist has search on their own in the past 3 years

		My dad always would say you kids are fortune to have the internet and Google when it comes time for you to find information. When he was kid you had to scour the library for books to find the information he needed. I did do that when I was in elementary school, but then here comes middle school, high school and college where everything is accessible. 

		Yes, it is quite a benefit, but it actually uncomforatble to know someone I do not is collecting data on me based on my searches, likes, past purchases, etc. It reminds me I have to be mindful and honestly make me want to limit my social presence, but how can I do that when everything is made simply from the internet. I use try and buy like DVDs and books to have a physical copy to start and try to be in the real world and have some kind of privacy.
