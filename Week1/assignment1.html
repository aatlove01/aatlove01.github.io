		<h2 style="font-family: courier;font-size: 1vw;"> <b> As We May Think by Vannevar Bush</b> </h2>
		<p style= "font-family:courier;"> Bush's goal through this essay was to urge the fellow American scientists at the time to create more accesible store of knowledge. He saw a limitation in how we can make true use of recording-keeping. As the information during the war continues to grow just as our memories, he called for more powerful instrumentalities as the use of science improves increasingly. He called for the scinetists to find a way to share their works and discoveries so they can consult with ease.The information stored, so he considered a future device at which he coined the "memex". A memex is a device where an individual stored all his books, records and communications shared so it can be consulted on in great speed and flexibilty. He was coming up with what we know today as our modern day computer, the internet and the web.  </p>

		<h3 style= "font-family:courier;font-size: 1vw"> <b> Long Live the Web by Tim Berners-Lee </b> </h3>
		<p style= "font-family:courier;"> I grew up during a time as the computer, internet and web. I remember having a little more freedom. I could listen to music for free. Before Hulu became the Hulu we came to know and pay subscriptions for, I was able to  watch movies for free. I remember going to the site only to see I have to pay now. Berners-Lee sees the Web evoloving into a very powerful tool as well, but also see the threats we as users can face in different ways. The Web is an open source tool I got used to as I grew up; I never considered my privacy will be threathened or others would use the web to force others to pay for faster paid service or to censoring information from the users. I find it interesting the internet and web was made to be a tool, but instead it is becoming a weapon. I find it sad that we can start noticing these things or hear about them and do not believe it until it is too late to do anything.   </p>
